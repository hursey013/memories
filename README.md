# Memories ‚Äî ‚ÄúOn This Day‚Äù from Synology Photos

Memories picks a photo taken **on this day in past years** from your Synology Photos library and sends it to you through **Apprise** (SMS/MMS, Push, Email, Discord, etc.). Wake up to a little nostalgia ‚òïüì∏

---

## What you need

- A Synology NAS with **DSM** and **Synology Photos** enabled.
- **Container Manager** (Docker) on your NAS.
- Either:
  - An existing **Apprise API** server you can point to, **or**
  - Run Apprise API alongside Memories

---

## Quick setup

### 1) Create a Synology user for Memories (optional but recommended)

- DSM ‚Üí **Control Panel ‚Üí User & Group** ‚Üí add a user like `memories`.
- Give it **read-only** access to the shared folders where your Photos live.

### 2) Open Container Manager ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Create

When prompted, choose **Create using docker‚Äëcompose**, then copy and paste one of the examples below directly into the editor. Adjust the values for your environment, then click **Next** to deploy.

## Tips & FAQs

- **Schedule or run once?** Set `CRON_EXPRESSION` to a cron string to run daily. If you leave it blank, Memories runs once and exits.
- **Where does it store data?** In the `./cache` folder mounted on your NAS (JSON index to keep track of previouslhy sent photos in order to avoid repeats). Safe to delete if you want to force a rebuild.
- **Stuck?** Check container logs in **Container Manager ‚Üí Containers ‚Üí memories ‚Üí Logs** for helpful messages.
